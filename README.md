# Bearing-Anomaly-Detection-Project
NASA Bearing Dataset Analysis and Modelling for Predictive Maintenance - Technical Scale Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **bearing anomaly detection** using the **NASA Bearing Dataset** to develop predictive maintenance models. The goal is to build an effective system that can analyze sensor data and accurately predict bearing failures or anomalies in industrial machinery, helping to prevent costly downtime and improve maintenance strategies.

## Status: üöß Work in Progress üöß

This repository is currently under development, with core functionalities such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation actively being worked on. Full implementation is expected to be completed by next week.

### Upcoming Features:
- **Data preprocessing and Analysis** to clean and format sensor data from the NASA Bearing dataset.
- **Machine Learning models** to classify and predict bearing anomalies based on sensor readings.
- **Model evaluation and performance metrics** to assess the accuracy and reliability of anomaly predictions.
- **Visualization tools** to help interpret sensor data and predicted anomalies.
